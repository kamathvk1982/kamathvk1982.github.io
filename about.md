## What is Data Science?

Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. Data science is related to data mining and big data.

A Brief History of Data Science
The term data science has existed for the better part of the last 30 years and was originally used as a substitute for "computer science" in 1960. Approximately 15 years later, the term was used to define the survey of data processing methods used in different applications. In 2001, data science was introduced as an independent discipline. The Harvard Business Review published an article in 2012 describing the role of the data scientist as the “sexiest job of the 21st century.”
