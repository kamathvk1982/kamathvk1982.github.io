# Bike Share Systems (BSS) collection - Citi Bike Trip Histories - New York City

Experience NYC in a whole new way - Citi Bike is the nation's largest bike share program, with 20,000 bikes and over 1,300 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Jersey City. It was designed for quick trips with convenience in mind, and itâ€™s a fun and affordable way to get around town.


# Analysis Plan

* We will load the csv data into a temp object and then pull the distinct nodes and its characteristics and the linkages between the nodes.

* Degree centrality is defined as the Number of incoming links to a node. We can check the station having the maximum number of trips to it and we can further to see if the same station has the maximum degree centrality for each gender type and/or user types.
