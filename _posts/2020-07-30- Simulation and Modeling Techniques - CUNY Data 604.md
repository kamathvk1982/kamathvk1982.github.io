# Overview:

MyPlinko is a simple simulation of the popular game “Plinko” from the television series “The Price Is Right”. [http://www.priceisright.com/].

The game premise is simple; A flat disc is dropped onto a large board covered in small pegs. The disc bounces off these pegs as it drops down towards the bottom of the board. The bottom of the board catches the discs and different amount is won based on the bucket that the disc lands.

# Problem Statement: How to Win with maximum Amount?

* Dropping a ball into the right stationary bucket is way to earn cash in this game. They can earn you Ten, Hundred, or even Thousand dollars at a time, so if you land a ball in the correct one, you get a nice reward.

* Plinko-gaming-strategy No. 1: Basically, if you're in it to win highest dollars, stick to the middle slots. Simple enough.



My attempt here is to run multiple simulation to see if this strategy holds true.
